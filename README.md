Prosjekt_Ordspill
=================
With this project, were going to make a word-game.

The general design so far:
Words come raining down on the screen, and the players task is to write the words before they hit the bottom.

Our goal:
We want to use our current knowledge in Java to create a game that looks good. And functions smooth.
